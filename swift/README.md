# KhÃ­Ã­n for iOS & macOS

Folders:

- `Khiin`: Currently a blank app with a text field simply for testing the IME
- `Keyboard`: The iOS Keyboard Extension (`.appex`) Bundle code
- `KhiinIM`: The macOS Input Method
- `Protos`: The generated `.pb.swift` protobuf glass files
- `bridge`: A bridge module for Swift-Rust communication, using `swift-bridge`
  (Nb: we are currently using a custom fork until the changes get merged
  upstream)

The `Keyboard.appex` bundle will be embedded in the `Khiin.app` bundle for
delivery onto the device. 

## XCode

- **Note:** Set up your development environment before loading the project in
  XCode, or XCode will complain about missing files (these are generated during
  the setup)

When running the iOS simulator, XCode can be very flaky with respect to
rebuilding and running the latest code. If you need debugging (breakpoints and
logging), you must have your Scheme set to run the `Keyboard` target, not the
`Khiin` target. However, since the `Khiin` target contains the `Keyboard`
target, I have found the best results by following these steps:

1. Work on iOS code in the `Keyboard` folder
2. Build the `Khiin` target and run it on the simulator
3. Stop the execution of this process (hit the stop button at the top left)
4. Build the `Keyboard` target, and select the `Khiin` app to launch

This seems to work most of the time.

You will also need to enable the IME from the app settings to see it in the
keyboard selection menu. Go to Settings > Khiin > Keyboards > Khiin PJH to
enable it. Note that when selecting the keyboard, it is a bit flaky and does not
always load properly the first time, you may have to select it twice. (I am told
this is not a problem on actual devices, but I do not have one for testing.)

Note that you maye also see a warning when building the project:

```
Linking against a dylib which is not safe for use in application extensions:
/Users/.../SwiftProtobuf...
```

I have not yet figured out how to fix this warning, although it does not seem to
prevent any problems and the app runs as expected, and sometimes does not show
up at all.

## iOS Notes

- The iOS bundle identifier must start with something like `com.` or `org.`, and
  maybe a few others. However, we cannot use arbitrary bundle identifiers, as
  the original attempt to use `be.chiahpa` resulted in the IME not being
  recognized by the system.

## macOS Notes

- The macOS Input Method bundle identifier **must** have `.inputmethod.` in the
  **3rd** position. That is: `a.b.inputmethod.c` is a valid bundle identifier.
  This is apparently not documented anywhere, but it was mentioned on some
  obscure websites and in old header files.
- I have not yet figured out a good way to rebuild the macOS target while logged
  in as a user and testing it. So far it seems like we need to log out, delete
  the old one, rebuild, then log out again to activate it. Hopefully there is a
  better way...

## Development Environment

### Quickstart

Just run this:

```bash
brew install swift-protobuf
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin x86_64-apple-darwin aarch64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim x86_64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim x86_64-apple-ios
cargo install --force swift-bridge-cli
cargo install --force cargo-make
cargo make
```

You are now ready to build the apps in XCode ðŸ˜„

### Details

1. Use `cargo-make` for the commands listed in this document:

```bash
cargo install --force cargo-make
```

2. Install the appropriate toolchains:

```bash
# For macOS
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin x86_64-apple-darwin

# For iOS
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim x86_64-apple-ios

# For iOS simulator
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios-sim x86_64-apple-ios
```

3. Files in `Protos` are generated using Apple's `swift-protobuf` plugin.

- `cbindgen`: a tool for creating the C header files used from Swift
- `swift-protobuf`: Apple's Protobuf extension for Swift

```bash
brew install swift-protobuf
```

Once everything is done, you can run `cargo make` to prepare everything for
building the mac/iOS apps. The first time takes a little longer to build the
libraries, but after that you should see an output similar to the following:

```
$ cargo make

```

### Bridge Module

The `bridge` module is compiled using `swift-bridge` into a `KhiinBridge` swift
package that can be used in XCode directly. Building is a two-step process.

1. Use the `build.sh` (which uses `build.rs`) to produce the `libkhiin_swift.a`
   binaries for each platform.
2. Use the `swift-bridge-cli` tool to package the generated code and the
   binaries into a Swift Package for use in XCode.

The package is generated to `swift/KhiinBridge`, and can be added to XCode as a
normal local package dependency. The targets using this package must add a Build
Phase for the package.

- Right click the project, click `Add Packages...` -> `Add Local..` and select
  the `KhiinBridge` folder
- Navigate to the target -> `Build Phases` -> `Target Dependencies` and click
  the `+` button, selecting `KhiinBridge
- Repeat for `Link Binary With Libraries`

This configuration should already be done, so you shouldn't need to change it.

The binaries produced by `bridge/build.sh` are:

- `target/universal-ios/(debug|release)/libkhiin_swift.a` - for the simulator
- `target/aarch64-apple-ios/(debug|release)/libkhiin_swift.a` - for iOS devices
- `target/universal-macos/(debug|release)/libkhiin_swift.a` - for macOS devices
